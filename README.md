Hi, I'm Ergini.

I'm a software developer with four years of experience, specializing in modern web technologies, backend development, and creating AI-powered applications tailored to various needs. I love building solutions that genuinely help people by combining smart web apps and innovative AI.

### Tools & Technologies I Use
